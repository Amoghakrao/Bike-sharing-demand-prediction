Rental bikes have been introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility and comfort. It is important to make the rental bikes available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of the bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

First, the data set was loaded, and exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the data, including null value, duplicate, and outlier checks. All null values were addressed, duplicates removed, and outliers eliminated during this process.

Following necessary preprocessing steps, the data was split into test and training sets for the application of four machine learning models: linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, decision tree, and random forest. The models were evaluated based on performance metrics, with random forest emerging as the top-performing model, achieving the highest adjusted R squared value of 0.92 on both the training and test data.
